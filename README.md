# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Homework-8

This assignment was our introduction to BSTs (Binary Search Trees). In the add method I didnt use recursion but I still got the job done. 

This assignment was designed to be run in the Eclipse IDE. To run the tests to see them all pass you can run each test file one at a time. 

To find the code that the tests are testing you can follow the file path, src -> edu/uwm/cs351 -> realty.java. This file contains all of the code I wrote. The rest was provided. 

Attatched is the assignment instructions.
