# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Homework-8

This assignment was our introduction to BSTs (Binary Search Trees). In the add method I didnt use recursion but I still got the job done. 

This assignment was designed to be run in the Eclipse IDE. To run the tests to see them all pass you can run each test file one at a time. 

Attatched is the assignment instructions.
